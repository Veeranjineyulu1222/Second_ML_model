# ðŸ“Š Second Machine Learning Model â€“ Linear Regression  

This repository contains my **Day 2 Machine Learning project**, where I trained a *Randomforest Regression model** to understand the basics of supervised learning and model evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  

- **Goal**: Build and train a simple regression model.  
- **Algorithm Used**: Randomforest Regression (Scikit-learn).  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Importing & exploring the dataset  
  2. Preprocessing data (handling features/target)  
  3. Splitting into training and testing sets  
  4. Training a Randomforest Regression model  
  5. Evaluating with metrics like **MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ²**  
  6. Visualizing results
